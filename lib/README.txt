The bundled Eclipse .classpath points to this directory to find
the required Rserve jar packages:

 <classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/REngine.jar"/>
 <classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/RserveEngine.jar"/>

Rserve is needed for the communication between Java and R. The library is
developed by Simon Urbanek and the sources are licensed under GPL.

To download the files (under Linux), issue:
./getlibs.sh
